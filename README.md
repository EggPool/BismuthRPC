# BismuthRPC
A Json-RPC Server for Bismuth Crypto Currency 

A python json-rpc server that will allow to interact with a bismuth node like we do with bitcoind.
Will ease integration of Bismuth with exchanges and pools.

This will be an independant server, not necessarly part of the core node code.

*WIP*
