# BismuthRPC
A Json-RPC Server for [Bismuth Crypto Currency](https://github.com/hclivess/Bismuth)  

A python json-rpc server that will allow to interact with a bismuth node like we do with bitcoind.
Will ease integration of Bismuth with exchanges and pools.

This will be an independent server, not necessarily part of the core node code.

# Current status

All info and current state of working commands is in the [Commands.md file](RPCServer/Commands.md)
