# Demo PHP/Html Wallet 

This wallet is a simple PHP/Html bitcoin wallet using json-rpc.

It's used as a simple test for the bismuth json-rpc server.

Forked from https://github.com/mpatterson99/phpBitAdmin-Bitcoin-HTML5-Wallet/tree/master/wallet_light

Only for tests, do not base further dev from that one for now (better use a full static html/js version)
