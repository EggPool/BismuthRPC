# Python RPC server for Bismuth

WIP.  

Just sending mockup data right no, no connection to a real bismuth node.  
Only testing the service/client rpc protocol.

## Install

See requirements.txt from upper dir.
`pip3 install -r requirementS.txt`

## Config

Default config, that will always ship with the release, is 
> bismuthd.default.conf

Users can copy to
> bismuthd.conf

to define custom settings.  
You only need to define what changes, not everything.

## Run

`python3 bismuthd.py`
